## Topics: 
A site for a _**fictitious**_ podcast.

## Title:
Tuning Into the Noise

## Site Description: 
It's a site about the phantom podcast Tuning Into the Noise! See their latest releases, find out about the team behind it, the podcast's origins, and where you can find them! The name of the podcast comes from the fact that anyone who visits this page is trying to tune into noise â€” searching for a signal (or in this case a radio station) that doesn't exist.

A member of the team details the podcast's completely made-up history, starting from its founding in 2012 to its growth up to 2022. We look into the various guest stars and special events the show's had across the years. We also tease a bit of the plans the team's been working on behind the scenes.

### Page Five: Latest Releases and Where to Find Us (assigned to Miguel)
It's a list of the most recent episodes (ten episodes) with short descriptions and a bunch of fake social media links, and share buttons. The episodes will not actually be playable.
